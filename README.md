***VIT-BIT is inspired from my day to day struggle of checking the mess schedule for my hostel. The mess schedule (for a month) is available in the form of notice stuck on the walls of mess. You can take a pic and everytime you want to check the day's menu, you would need to scrap through your gallery to find the latest menu. This application terminates the need for storing a pic. An ML-Integrated API which scan the menu items from image and drafts a excel file which is then read to formulated a time-table patterned menu is used. Developer would need to scan the menu once every month. An application widget is also available to check the menu items from the home screen itself.***

---

### Future Works:

- Integrate the ML based API which would automate the task of scanning the Menu.
- Add database which would store the mess menu for different hostel block(Girls/Boys).

*Note: The menu which is currently available is of Q-Block (Boys Hostel), Special Mess.*

## Updating Schedule Monthly:
- Generate new Excel(xls) file and copy paste its contents in ``mess_schedule.xls`` file.
- In ``Constants.kt`` file, change TIME_REGEX month accordingly.
